            <p>Step 9 Productions is the solo project of myself, Ross Duncan. I got started in
                music as a drummer and percussionist, playing in wind orchestras and jazz
                ensembles, whilst getting stuck into learning electronic music production. Between
                2013 and 2017, I ran a mobile DJ service for birthday parties, school
                events and other private functions. From this point, I knew that a career
                in professional audio would be my future.

            <p>I moved to Bristol in 2016 to study audio and music technology at the 
                University of the West of England. Whilst studying, I circulated amongst the
                music producer, DJ, live music, hospitality and promoter communities. I have
                played DJ sets, helped run events and set up equipment at various Bristol
                events and venues, most notably the famous Lakota nightclub, where I set up
                the decks and lighting, and operated lights during clubs nights, for artists
                such as Digital Mystikz, Calibre and many more. I've also mixed and mastered
                music of fellow electronic musicians and bands.
            </p>
            <p>Whilst studying and upon graduation, I freelanced with various events hire
                companies and theatres as part of their stage, sound and lighting crews. A full
                list of events I've worked on is on the Portfolio / Live Events section of this
                site.

            <p>In January 2020, I worked for arts organisation Wiltshire Creative, who run
                the Salisbury Playhouse theatre and Salisbury Arts Centre. We catered for many
                visiting plays, musicals, corporate events and comedy nights.

            <p>In July 2020, I started working for Catholic radio organsation Radio Maria England
                as an audio technician, editing programmes, maintaining equipment and supervising
                volunteers.
            </p>
            <p>I set up this site to get in contact with other musicians, music producers and
                media groups who are looking for help with the audio side of their projects.
                I would love to provide my skills to help out. If your requirements are unusual,
                please don't hesistate to specify! Many thanks to Design Supply UK for making this
